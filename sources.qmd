This data is from the government of Alberta's Interactive Health Data
Application. I downloaded Age-Sex Specific Multiple Sclerosis Incidence Rate
Data. I also used the [Wes Anderson
Palettes](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) R package created by [Karthik
Ram](https://github.com/karthik) from Github for the colors in my graphs.
